## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Build Failures**
```bash
# If build fails due to memory issues
Problem: Large dependencies like XGBoost/CatBoost
Solution: Render's free tier handles this automatically
```

### **App Not Starting**
```bash
# Check these configurations:
✅ Procfile points to correct file: application:app
✅ Port configuration in application.py
✅ All required files present in repository
```

### **Model Loading Issues**
```bash
# Ensure artifacts folder is in repository:
artifacts/
├── model.pkl
├── preprocessor.pkl
├── train.csv
└── test.csv
```

## 🎉 **Post-Deployment Checklist**

### **Verify Functionality**:
1. ✅ Homepage loads successfully
2. ✅ Prediction form accepts input
3. ✅ Model predictions work correctly
4. ✅ No console errors in browser

### **Performance Optimization**:
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity (free tier)
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Subsequent requests are fast

### **Custom Domain** (Optional):
- Render allows custom domains on free tier
- Configure DNS settings in your domain provider
- Add domain in Render dashboard
